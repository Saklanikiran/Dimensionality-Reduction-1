    "\n",
    "The curse of dimensionality refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces \n",

    "Importance in Machine Learning:\n",
    "Efficiency: High-dimensional data can lead to inefficient computations and increased storage requirements.\n",
    "Performance: Machine learning models may perform poorly with high-dimensional data due to overfitting, where models capture noise instead of underlying patterns.\n",
